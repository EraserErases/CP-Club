'''
The area of a triangle can be computed using the following formula, where b is the
length of the base of the triangle, and h is its height:

area = b × h / 2

Write a program that allows the user to enter values for b and h. The program
should then compute and display the area of a triangle with base length b and height h.
'''

b = float(input('Base: '))
h = float(input('Height: '))

print(f'The area of the triangle is {b * h * .5}.')
